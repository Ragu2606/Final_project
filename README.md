### **Approach Breakdown:**

1. **Stage 1: Data Ingestion and Initial Processing**
   - **Python Script for S3 Upload:** Automate the transfer of sales files to S3 using a Python script. Ensure proper error handling and logging.
   - **AWS Glue ETL Jobs:** Set up scheduled Glue jobs to clean and merge files. Use Glue Crawlers to infer schema and automate transformations.
   - **Lambda Function:** Configure Lambda to trigger on S3 events to load data into AWS RDS. Ensure the function handles various file formats and error cases.

2. **Stage 2: Feature Data Management**
   - **HDFS Storage:** Store feature data in HDFS. Use tools like Hadoop Distributed File System commands to manage the data.
   - **PySpark Data Processing:** Develop PySpark scripts to clean and transform data, then push it to Hive tables. Make sure your transformations are efficient and well-documented.

3. **Stage 3: Data Consolidation**
   - **AWS RDS Integration:** Ensure that data from AWS RDS is clean and consolidated before transferring.
   - **Sqoop Transfers:** Use Sqoop to move data from AWS RDS to Hive. Optimize Sqoop configurations for performance.

4. **Stage 4: Integration of Stages**
   - **Seamless Integration:** Test the integration of stages 1, 2, and 3. Ensure that data flows smoothly between them with minimal manual intervention.

5. **Stage 5: Data Storage and Processing**
   - **PySpark Jobs:** Write and optimize PySpark jobs to process and store data in RDS or files as needed. Implement robust error handling and logging.

6. **Stage 6: Pipeline Orchestration**
   - **Apache Airflow:** Set up Airflow DAGs to orchestrate the workflow across stages. Ensure that the pipeline is resilient to failures and includes retries and notifications.

7. **Stage 7: Monitoring**
   - **Prometheus & Grafana:** Implement Prometheus for monitoring and set up Grafana dashboards for visualizing pipeline metrics. Ensure alerts are configured for critical issues.

### **Business Use Cases Implementation:**

1. **Customer Visit Analysis:** Use SQL queries or PySpark to calculate the average customer visits for type B stores in April.

2. **Holiday Sales Analysis:** Analyze sales data during holiday weeks to find average sales by store type.

3. **Leap Year Sales Analysis:** Determine sales performance during leap years and identify the store with the worst performance.

4. **Sales Prediction with Unemployment Factor:** Build a regression model to predict sales based on unemployment rates.

5. **Monthly Sales Aggregation:** Aggregate sales data monthly for each department and analyze trends.

6. **Weekly High Sales Store Identification:** Identify the store with the highest sales each week.

7. **Department Performance Analysis:** Analyze sales performance by department on a weekly basis.

8. **Fuel Price Analysis:** Determine the store with the lowest fuel prices on a weekly basis.

9. **Yearly Store Performance Analysis:** Evaluate and compare store performance year-wise.

10. **Weekly Performance Analysis with/without Offers:** Compare store performance with and without promotions to assess the impact of offers.

### **Project Deliverables:**

- **Video Workflow:** Record a walkthrough of the entire pipeline, including data ingestion, processing, and analysis. Highlight key features and any challenges faced.
- **GitHub Repository:** Ensure your GitHub repo includes all code, scripts, and configurations. Exclude sensitive information like passwords.
- **README File:** Create a detailed README that explains:
  - **Project Overview:** Describe the problem and solution.
  - **Setup Instructions:** Provide steps to set up and run the project.
  - **Usage:** Explain how to use the scripts and tools.
  - **Business Use Cases:** Detail how each use case is addressed.
  - **Monitoring:** Describe how to use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
